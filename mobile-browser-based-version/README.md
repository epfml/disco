# Mobile Browser-Based Version
## How to run the app
All commands are ran from the folder ./mobile-browser-based-version.  
### Node Installation and NPM installation
The app is running under Node 15.12.0. It can be downloaded from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/).

NPM is a package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.  
To start the application (running locally) run the following command.    
Note: the application is currently developed using [NPM 7.6.3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm/v/7.6.3).
```
npm install
```
This command will install the necessary libraries required to run the application (defined in the `package.json` and `package-lock.json`). The latter command is only required when one is using the app for the first time. 

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
To launch the application run the following command: 
```
npm run serve
```
This will start the application locally with two visualization options: 
1. One can access the running app locally, with a ` localhost link` 
2. One can access the running app on any device that has access to the network of his machine. To do so, use the `network link`.

> Note : the node.js sever application in `server/` needs to launched first (see [corresponding README](server/README.md)) to be able to run the `vue-app`

To **test decentralized learning** between two peers, run the aformentioned command twice (on different terminal pages). This will create another link that can be used to represent a second user. Open the two links on two different page windows.    
Please note that currently, only the titanic task has been configured to have a decentralized training loop. 

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

## How to create a new task 
The task creation process will now be presented: 
1. In the folder ./src/components create a new folder for a new task. 
2. If one desires to create a task that relies on tabular data (i.e CSV files), in the created folder, he will copy the files from the titanic example. On the other hand, if one wishes to create a model that uses images as input, he will copy in the previously created folder the files from the MNIST example. 
3. Rename the copied file using your task name. For instance, titanic_desc can be renamed [your_task_name]_desc. 
4. Change the information in the javascript file to suit the requirements of the created task. There are three main objects to change. The first one is called display_informations. It contains all the textual task-related information. The second one is called training_information and holds all the information about the model (i.e model's name, architecture ...). The third one is the data_preprocessing function. This function takes the user's uploaded files and returns the processed data as a tensor. 
5. In each vue file, look for the script part of the code (after <script>)  and replace the first import with the javascript associated with your task.  For instance, replace import {...} from "titanic_script" with import {...} from "[your_task_name]_script". 
6. Add your task to the routing file in ./src/router/index.js. More instructions soon to come. 

## Explanation of the current architecture of the app
### Overview of the architecture
Tasks are organized around the following files: 
- vue files are used to render the task-related user interface. Users should not modify the core code of these files. 
- a javascript file contains all the task-related information and methods. For instance, in this file, one can find the specific data-processing function or the textual description of the task. 

### Use of Vue.js
The main front-end framework used by the application is Vue.js. It's a widely used framework to build single-page UI (See [Reference](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/)).    
The application is built around Vue.js components. Essentially, components are defined around two parts: 
1. An HTML template that states how the component should be rendered 
2. A script that defines the behaviors of the components

### Components architecture of the project 
Components can be organized in a parent/child relation. Meaning that one can have a parent component that holds many other child components.  
`routers` are used to define which components are displayed to the user depending on the user's inputs. 

The application runs the following architecture: 
- **The global component** of the app is called `App.vue`. This component implements a mini-side bar that is always displayed to the user. This mini-sidebar allows the user to directly access the available list of tasks available, and change some parameters of the page (color and night mode).
- **Information Display Components** are components that are displayed on the right side of the mini-side bar. Depending on the user's path choice, a component is displayed. The following components can be displayed:
  - **The task list component** is called `TaskList.vue`. It's the default component used to fill this space. It shows which ML tasks are open for collaborative training. 
  - **Task-related Components** are components used to display the interface associated with a particular task. The UI components for an ML task come in a parent-child relation: one global component (called `[taskName]_model.vue`) is used to implement a sidebar that allows the user to navigate through the different components associated with a task. On the right side of this global component, the following components are used to create a task (and note that all of them need to be created for each task): 
    - **Description of the task** under the name `[taskName]_description.vue. It gives an overview of the task. 
    - **Training of the task** under the name `[taskName]_training.vue`. Allows the users to train a model, either collaboratively using p2p communication, or alone by local training. As a side note, components are created only when they are called by the user. Meaning that until the user reaches the training page of the task, the `[taskName]_training.vue`is not created. When a user reaches for the first time the training components, the component is created, and only then the NN model is created and stored in the browser's indexdb database. The training is done in a seperated script. To start training, the function named `join_training`is called. This function preprocess the data using the task specific data pre-processing function and then train the model using the shared `train`function. 

All these are served by the javascript file associated to the task. 

### Training Loop
A global function `training` is called by all components that are training a model. This function is located in the file ./helpers/training.js.   
The idea is that the training part for all tasks follows the same ML backend, while the processing of the data is done locally (at the component level) by each task.   
The training process works as follow:
1. When a user has stated that he wishes to join the training of a task, a model is created (for now with a standards initialization) and stored into the browser's local storage. (call to `create_model`, a function embedded into the task's training component)
2. Once the user uploads a dataset, a pre-processing function is called. The pre-processing function is specifically tailored for each task and so is embedded in the task's training component under the name `data_preprocessing`. 
3. Once the data has been pre-processed, the `training` function is called. This function loads the model from the browser's local storage and updates the model by training it on the given dataset. As mentioned earlier, this function is shared by all training components.

## Communication between peers 
Explanations on communication between peers coming out soon. 

## Some further integrations notes 
### Mobile Intergration 
Depending on the user's screen size, the sidebar associated to task's components can disapear and be open using a button located on the left corner of the user's screen. 
For now a template that shows how to create tasks can be found.
