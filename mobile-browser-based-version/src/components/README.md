# `Vue` architecture documentation
---

## Introduction

This folder contains all `vue-files` that compose the web application.

A strong focus was put on software engineering best practices to ease the future development stages. A list of simple guidelines to write good `vue` code is made available in the [Code guidelines section](#code-guidelines).

## Root pages description

All pages that are available for the `side-bar` (as well as the `NotFound.vue` ) are referred to as root pages, aka the pages that are at the root of the component hierarchy.

An extensive list can be found below:

    .
    ├── App.vue                  # basic app layout (sidebar, router and state variables)
    ├── Home.vue                 # home page that links TaskList.vue and NewTaskCreationForm.vue
    ├── Information.vue          # Displays basic information about the platform
    ├── NewTaskCreationForm.vue  # Form that adds a new task to the platform
    ├── NotFound.vue             # Error page that is displayed when a session error occurs
    └── TaskList.vue             # Displays all tasks available in the platform

## Reusable Components 

In this section, we will define `vue` components that can be reused by the rest of the platform using :
1. style templates ([Simple directory](#simple-directory)) 
2. layout templates ([Container directory](container-directory))

Both approaches are described in the following sections.

### `Simple` directory

The directory defines pre-styled html components such as `Button` or `Footer` (see images below).

> **Note**: the naming convention for files in this directory is `CustomXXX.vue` where `XXX` is the feature of the new component. They shall be imported using the `kebab-case` naming version:  
```html 
<custom-xxx/>
```
See [Naming convention section](#naming-conventions) for more information.
### `Container` directory

The `container` directory holds all `vue` components that fulfil a container function. In other words, most components in this folder make extensive use of the [slot `vue` contruct](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/component-slots.html) 

```html 
<slot name="XXX"></slot>
```

This "slot" can hold `vue` code generated by a parent component. Therefore, it allows defining pre-styled containers.

The `containers` defined for this particular webapp are described below.

#### Base Layout

**Each root page** shall start its `template` by the `<base-layout>` tag. This `base layout` contains basic style for the main `divs` of the app and already contains the footer of the app.

#### Cards

`Cards` are containers that are displayed inside other main containers (e.g.`base layout`) with a darker background than the main background (with rounded-corners).

The following types are available : 

| Component       |      Description                                                       | 
|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Card.vue`      | simple `div` with darker background                                    | 
| `TitleCard.vue` | a `Card` but with a stylised title added as `props`                    |   
| `IconCard`      | a `Card` having a header section with a title and an icon on the right |   
| `IconCardSmall` | Smaller version of `IconCard` (e.g. used in `TrainingInformant.vue`)   |

## Code guidelines

For an inexperienced `Vue` developer, we recommend going through [the official onboarding documentation of Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html).

### Naming conventions

Let's assume, we want to have a `vue` compoment with functionality `xxx yyy`.

In this project, we chose to follow :
1. The `snakeCase` standard for the files names : `XxxYyy.vue`
2. The `kebab-case` stantard for the exported component name : `xxx-yyy`

This means that each `vue` file shall contain the following code

```javascript
export default {
  name: 'xxx-yyy',
}
```

and that another `vue` component can use it inside its template using the following syntax:

```html 
<xxx-yyy/>
```

> **Note**: all `javascript` code inside the `<script></script>` tag shall respect the ES6 standard, in particular the imports statements. See [Helpers folder README](../helpers/README.md) for more information.
