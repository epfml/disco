# `Vue` architecture documentation
---

## Introduction

This folder contains all `vue-files` that compose the web application.

A strong focus was put on software engineering best practices to ease the future development stages. A list of simple guidelines to write good `vue` code is made available in the [Code guidelines section](#code-guidelines).

## Root pages description

All pages that are available for the `side-bar` (as well as the `NotFound.vue` ) are referred to as root pages, aka the pages that are at the root of the component hierarchy.

An extensive list can be found below:

    .
    ├── App.vue                  # basic app layout (sidebar, router and state variables)
    ├── Home.vue                 # home page that links TaskList.vue and NewTaskCreationForm.vue
    ├── Information.vue          # Displays basic information about the platform
    ├── NewTaskCreationForm.vue  # Form that adds a new task to the platform
    ├── NotFound.vue             # Error page that is displayed when a session error occurs
    └── TaskList.vue             # Displays all tasks available in the platform

## Reusable Components 

In this section, we will define `vue` components that can be reused by the rest of the platform using :
1. style templates ([Simple directory](#simple-directory)) 
2. layout templates ([Container directory](container-directory))

Both approaches are described in the following sections.

### `Simple` directory

The directory defines pre-styled html components such as `Button` or `Footer` (see images below).

> **Note**: the naming convention for files in this directory is `CustomXXX.vue` where `XXX` is the feature of the new component. They shall be imported using the `kebab-case` naming version:  ```html <custom-xxx/> ```
See [Naming convention section](#naming-conventions) for more information.
### `Container` directory

The `container` directory holds all `vue` components that fulfil a container function. In other words, most components in this folder make extensive use of the [slot `vue` contruct](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/component-slots.html) ```html <slot name="XXX"></slot> ```

This "slot" can hold `vue` code generated by a parent component. Therefore, it allows defining pre-styled containers.

The `containers` defined for this particular webapp are described below.

## Code guidelines

TODO:

For an inexperienced `Vue` developer, we recommend going through [the official onboarding documentation of Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html).

### Naming conventions

TODO:

`kebab-case`

> **Note**: all `javascript` code inside the `<script></script>` tag shall respect the ES6 standard, in particular the imports statements. See [Helpers folder README](../helpers/README.md) for more information.
