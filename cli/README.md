# DISCO Command Line Interface

The CLI lets one use DISCO in standalone manner (i.e. without running a server or browser backend manually). The CLI allows to conveniently simulate multiple clients and log metrics such as the training and validation accuracy of each client. Integration of DISCO into other apps can follow the same principles (no browser needed). Currently, the CLI only support running federated tasks. Since the CLI relies on Node.js, it uses DISCO through `discojs-node`.

For example, the following command trains a model on CIFAR10, using 4 federated clients for 15 epochs with a round duration of 5 epochs (see [DISCOJS.md](../docs/DISCOJS.md#rounds) for more information on rounds)

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you first ran `./get_training_data.sh` (in the root folder) to download training data.

```
# From the root folder
npm -w cli start -- --task cifar10 --numberOfUsers 4 --epochs 15 --roundDuration 5
# Or from the cli folder directly
npm start -- --task cifar10 --numberOfUsers 4 --epochs 15 --roundDuration 5
```
or using the shorter alias notation:
```
npm -w cli start -- -t cifar10 -u 4 -e 15 -r 5
```
You can find all the command arguments with:
```
npm -w cli start -- --help #Â or -h
```

## Adding new tasks

The CLI can be used on several pre-defined tasks: titanic, simple-face and CIFAR10. In order
to understand how to add a new task have a look at [TASK.md](../docs/TASK.md).

Once a new task has been defined in `discojs`, it can be loaded in [data.ts](./src/data.ts) as it is already implemented for current tasks. There are currently [multiple classes](../discojs/discojs-node/src/dataset/data_loader) you can use to load data using Node.js and preprocess data: ImageLoader, TabularLoader and TextLoader.
Once a function to load data has been added, make sure to extend `getTaskData` in `data.ts`, which matches each task with it respective with data loading function.

The last thing to add is to add the task as a CLI argument in [args.ts](./src/args.ts) to the `supportedTasks` Map.
You should now be able to run your task as follows:
```
npm -w cli start -- --task your_task --numberOfUsers 4 --epochs 15 --roundDuration 5
```
