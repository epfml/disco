/**
 * The AsyncWeightsBuffer class holds and manipulates information about the
 * async weights buffer. It works as follows:
 *
 * Setup: Init round to zero and create empty buffer (a map from user id to weights)
 *
 * - When a user adds weights only do so when they are recent weights: i.e. this.round - round <= roundCutoff.
 * - If a user already added weights, update them. (-> there can be at most one entry of weights per id in a buffer).
 * - When the buffer is full, call aggregateAndStoreWeights with the weights in the buffer and then increment round by one  and reset the buffer.
 *
 * @remarks
 * taskID: corresponds to the task that weights correspond to.
 * bufferCapacity: size of the buffer.
 * buffer: holds a map of users to their added weights.
 * round: the latest round of the weight buffer.
 * roundCutoff: cutoff for accepted rounds.
