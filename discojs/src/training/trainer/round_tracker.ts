/**

 * In distributed training, the client trains locally for a certain amount of epochs before sharing his weights to the server/neighbor, this

 *
 * The role of the RoundTracker is to keep track of when a roundHasEnded using the current batch number. The batch in the RoundTracker is cumulative whereas
 * in the onBatchEnd it is not (it resets to 0 after each epoch).
