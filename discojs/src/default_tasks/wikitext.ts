As an example, you can try the Wikitext-103 dataset, composed of Wikipedia articles, widely used in natural language modeling, which you can download <a class='underline text-blue-400' target='_blank' href='https://dax-cdn.cdn.appdomain.cloud/dax-wikitext-103/1.0.1/wikitext-103.tar.gz'>here</a>.

The model is trained via an Adam optimizer with unit gradient clipping and softmax cross-entropy loss. To accommodate all devices, the context length is currently kept at 128 and the batch size at 1.',
