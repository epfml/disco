          <b>Goal</b><br>
          Disco enables collaborative and privacy-preserving training of machine learning models. Disco is an easy-to-use mobile app & web software, running directly in your browser.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
          <b>Key Question</b><br>
          Can we keep control over our own data, while still benefitting from joint collaborative training with other participants? - or - Can we train an ML model which is equally good as if all data were in one place, but while respecting privacy? Federated and decentralized learning make this possible.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
          <b>Federated learning</b><br>
          The key insight is to share weight updates instead of data - each user trains on their own device and periodically shares weight updates with a central server, while keeping data local at all times. The server will agreggate all these weights between participants, and send them back.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
          <b>Decentralized learning</b><br>
          Building upon the same principles as in federated learning, decentralized learning achieved allows collaboration and data privacy without the need for a central coordinator. Updates are shared purely via peer2peer communication. Disco puts users in control of the entire collaborative training process, without a central point of failure.

            <b>Foundation technology</b>
            <br/>DISCO uses a public model-private data approach.
            The models are trained on the web app via
