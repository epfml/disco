Welcome to the DiscoðŸ”® developer guide. To get up and running you can find the relevant information here as well as in the [server](server/README.md) document.

If you run into any sort of trouble then hopefully you can find an answer in our [faq](information/FAQ.md); otherwise please create a new issue. If you want to contribute to DiscoðŸ”®, then please have a look at our [contributing](information/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide; and if you are curious about our architecture you can find information [here](information/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Structure

Disco is composed of three parts:

1. [browser](browser/README.md)
2. [server](server/README.md)
3. [discojs](discojs/README.md)

The parts are self explanatory in their name, except for `discojs`, this contains the core code of Disco
